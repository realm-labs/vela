## 2026-05-24: Start With A Dedicated `vela_common` Crate

Common IDs, spans, diagnostics, and symbol interning live in `vela_common`
instead of the root package. This keeps later parser, bytecode, VM, host, and
reflection crates sharing one stable foundation without circular ownership.

Stable IDs are transparent newtypes over integer primitives so they remain
cheap to copy while preventing accidental mixing between fields, methods, host
objects, source files, and related schema items.
